# 4995 Industries Presents: Whiteboard

## What is it?

"Whiteboard" is a real-time collaborative whiteboard application developed by CS 4995 students at the University of Minnesota-Duluth.

## Setup

1. Download and set up the [NodeJS whiteboard server](https://github.com/umdcs4995/whiteboard_server)
2. Change the values in app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml to match your server address
    - Change "hostname" to your server hostname
    - Change rtc_port to your RTC signalling port (3001 by default)
    - If your server is NOT running over HTTPS (most people):
        - Change "secure" to false
        - Change "port" to your server port (3000 by default)
    - Otherwise, if you ARE running over HTTPS:
        - Change "secure_port" to your HTTPS port
3. Build and run the Android application (we use Android Studio)

## Nodejs Development Information

The server is written in Javascript using [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org), and most of the client-server communication uses [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/). This means that most of the communication is *asynchronous*, so you need to write your code in a way that can be executed asynchronously without problems. There are good examples of this in JoinBoardFragment.java.

### Building messages

Message data needs to be packaged in a JSONObject or JSONArray in order to be sent via socketio. This is pretty easy to do:

    JSONObject jsonData = new JSONObject();
    jsonData.put("name", "testBoard");

Sometimes it helps to think about JSONObjects is as HashMap<String,Object> and JSONArrays as List<Object> (though technically speaking, this isn't totally correct).

### Sending and receiving a message

In order to send or receive a message, your class needs to have access to the global SocketService. You can access this through the Globals singleton:

    final SocketService socket = Globals.getInstance().getSocketService();

Sending a message can be done through the sendMessage method, which takes a string and either a string, JSONObject, or JSONArray. Message types are stored in a "struct" called Messages within SocketService.

    socket.sendMessage(SocketService.Messages.CREATE_WHITEBOARD, jsonData);

SendMessage will throw an error if it does not have a connection to the server, so make sure to check for that.

To receive a message, you need to set up a listener, which is usually an anonymous function that will get called when the server send s message back with the given message type (such as createWhiteboard).

For example, to set up a listener to for a createWhiteboard message,

    socket.addListener(SocketService.Messages.CREATE_WHITEBOARD, new Emitter.Listener() {
        @Override
        public void call(Object... args) {
            
            // args[0] is a string containing the server's response, which we parse into a JSONObject
            JSONObject recvd = (JSONObject) args[0];
            
            try {
                Log.i("createWhiteboard", "received message: " + recvd.getString("message"));
            } catch (JSONException e) {
                Log.e("createWhiteboard", "error parsing received message");
            }
            
            // After we have successfully processed the response, 
            // remove the listener so it doesn't get called again.
            socket.clearListener(SocketService.Messages.CREATE_WHITEBOARD);
        }
    });

### Debugging messages

You can see a live log of the public server at https://lempo.d.umn.edu:4995/log.html

Additionally, you can simulate a real client and test sending messages at https://lempo.d.umn.edu:4995/console.html

### Server message types

| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| createWhiteboard | Creates a whiteboard. | name | A success or error message |
| joinWhiteboard   | Joins a whiteboard.   | name | A success or error message |
| deleteWhiteboard | Deleted a whiteboard. | name | A success or error message |
| me               | Allows user to get information about themselves | none | A JSONObject with 'whiteboard' property containing user's current whiteboard |
| chat message     | Blast a message to all users | message | The message |
| drawevent        | Sends a drawevent to users in the current whiteboard | drawevent object generated by DrawProtocol | none |

## Getting Google Sign-In and Google Drive Services to Function

Before you can build the app with OAuth2.0 Google Sign-in enabled and Googe Drive functionality [you will need to authenticate your client with their services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth) as well as create a [Google Developers Console Project](https://console.developers.google.com/).

Before you will be able to begin integrating Google Sign-In however, you must configure a Google Developers Console project and configure the Android Studio project. 

1. First, add the Google Play Services SDK if it is not added already:
    a. In Android Studio, select Tools > Android > SDK Manager. 
    b. At the bottom of the package list select Extras > Google Play services. 

2. Obtain your configuration file which contains service-specific information for your application. 
    
    a. [Go to the Google Developers Console](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating#get-config) and scroll down to the middle of the page and select the button that says "GET A CONFIGURATION FILE"
    
    b. You will need to create a new project and provide the package name for the application. You will also need to provide the SHA-1 hash of your signing certificate. 
        c. To obtain your SHA-1 hash:
        `   Go to a terminal and enter this command to obtain your SHA-1 certificate

                keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias <your-key-name> -keystore <path-to-production-keystore>

            Replace "your-key-name" and "path-to-production-keystore" appropriately. For example, on OSX:
    
                keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore

            Your key name should probably be unique, so you can use something like 'rysau001debugkey' instead.
    
            This command will output your SHA-1 key fingerprint. Save this!

3. Add the google-services.json file to your project:
    a. Copy the google-services.json file you just downloaded into the app/ directory of your Android Studio project. 
    b. Open the Android Studio Terminal pane and enter the following command, replacing path-to-download with the actual path:
        
        For MAC/LINUX: $ mv path-to-download/google-services.json app/

        For WINDOWS: $ move path-to-download/google-services.json app/

4. Add the Google Services plugin by updating your top-level build.gradle and your app-level build.gradle files as follows if they are not already added:
    a. Add the following dependency to your project-level build.gradle by copying/pasting the following line into your dependencies section:
        
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:2.0.0-alpha5'

    b. Add the plugin to the app-level build.gradle:
    
        apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

5. Add Google Play Services if it is not already added to the app-level build.gradle:
    
    a. in the app-level build.gradle file add the following line under dependencies:

        compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:8.4.0'

6. It is possible that you will also have to create a Google Developers Project:
    a. You can create a new project for free by selecting "Create a new project" from the project drop-down at the [Google Developers Console Web site](https://console.developers.google.com).

    b. From the "API Manager" sidebar, select Credentials, followed by the OAuth consent screen tab. 
        a. Select an email address, specify the product name (Whiteboard in this case, or a test project name if you do so choose), and select Save. 
    
    c. In the Credentials tab, select the New Credentials drop-down list, and select OAuth Client ID, then follow the rest of the steps to create the client ID.
